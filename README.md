# CodSoft_TASK_No.-2
# Movie Rating Prediction 
# Author: Gopal Krishna 
# Batch: July A58
# Domain: DATA SCIENCE 

# Aim:
The aim of this project is to predict movie ratings based on various features using machine learning techniques in Python. By analyzing historical data, we seek to build a model that can accurately predict the rating of a movie given certain attributes.

# Dataset:
The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of movies with associated features such as genre, director, cast, budget, and user reviews. This data is crucial for training our predictive model and evaluating its performance.

# Libraries Used:
To implement this project, we utilized several Python libraries including Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and NumPy for numerical computations. These libraries provided the necessary tools to preprocess the data, build the model, and analyze the results effectively.

# Data Processing:
Before training our model, we conducted extensive data preprocessing steps. This involved handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and performing feature engineering where necessary. Clean and well-prepared data is essential for building a robust machine learning model.

# Model Training:
For predicting movie ratings, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. We trained these models on a portion of the dataset and fine-tuned their parameters using techniques like cross-validation to enhance performance and prevent overfitting.

# Model Predictions:
After training our models, we evaluated their performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Once satisfied with the model's accuracy, we utilized it to make predictions on new, unseen data to estimate the ratings of movies not included in the training set.
# Conclusion:
This project not only explores the predictive capabilities of machine learning in the realm of movie ratings but also demonstrates the practical application of Python for data analysis and model building tasks.
